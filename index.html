            <p>My journey inward began with a longing to know myself beyond the noise of the world.</p>
            <p>After 14 years immersed in professional life, yet always feeling a quiet pull toward something deeper, I was drawn toward Yoga, meditation, and self-inquiry.</p>
            <p>I am a certified Yoga teacher specializing in Himalayan Kriya Yoga, Pranayama, and energy-based practices.</p>
            <p>Over the past seven years, I have explored various forms of meditation: Vipassana, Zen, Heartfulness, and Kriya, all pointing to the same truth: stillness, awareness, and a return to what is real within.</p>
            <p>My path has also been shaped by ancient wisdom from Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, Sankhya, Vijnana Bhairava Tantra, Vedanta, and Buddhist teachings.</p>
            <p>Each tradition revealed that what we seek is already hereâ€”not found in becoming more, but in fully meeting ourselves as we are.</p>
            <p>Whether you are new to this path or seeking to deepen your practice, I am here to share what I have learned and experienced.</p>
            <p>I offer personalized sessions to help you discover your own stillness and balance through breath, movement, and energy work.</p>
